# SkinCancerDetection


Melanoma, most threatening type of skin cancer,
is on the rise. In this paper an implementation of a deep-
learning system on a computer server, equipped with graphic
processing unit (GPU), is proposed for detection of melanoma
lesions. Clinical (non-dermoscopic) images are used in the
proposed system, which could assist a dermatologist in early
diagnosis of this type of skin cancer. In the proposed system,
input clinical images, which could contain illumination and
noise effects, are preprocessed in order to reduce such artifacts.
Afterward, the enhanced images are fed to a pre-trained
convolutional neural network (CNN) which is a member of
deep learning models. The CNN classifier, which is trained by
large number of training samples, distinguishes between
melanoma and benign cases. Experimental results show that
the proposed method is superior in terms of diagnostic
accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.
